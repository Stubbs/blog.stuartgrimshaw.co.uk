Some kids thrive on knowing they've won or lost, other shrink from it and a good coach can create an environment that both can have fun in.

    * SSGs always have a way to win or lose.
    * Recognise the kids that are not motivated by score & praise them based on how well they performed the objectives.
    * Praise the kids who need to win, but point out they won because they acheived the exersize.
