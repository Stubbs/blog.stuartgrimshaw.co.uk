# What is Lean Coaching

## The Toyota Way.

The Toyota Way, or Toyota Production System is the method developed at the manufacturer between 1948 & 1975 by Taichi Ohno and Eiji Toyoda and is widely credited as the main reason Toyota is the world leader that it is today. TPS is all about eliminating waste, in manufacturing this means things like not overproducing, not having too much stock, not moving stock or inventory that doesn't need to be moved, the waste of faulty products. By continuously changing their processes & procedures to get rid of any waste Toyota has risen from making no cars at all to the worlds largest motor manufacturer, overtaking the likes of Ford, General Motors and Volkswagon along the way.

You can read more about The Toyota Way in Jeffrey Liker's book [by the same name](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0071392319/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0071392319&linkCode=as2&tag=stuartgricom-21&linkId=JRNOOC4FX4V425PF)

## The Lean Startup.

Others have seen how successful the Toyota Way has been and applied it to other industries, perhaps one of the most famous is Eric Reis, the author of [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0670921602/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0670921602&linkCode=as2&tag=stuartgricom-21&linkId=7YEY4DIRAJ554POR). Eric applies the principle of minimizing waste to software development and startups. 

Here, waste isn't having too much stock or too much unnecessary movement of labor or products. Instead waste is seen as anything that doesn't move the business closer to the goals that it has set, and it uses small feedback loops to measure the effect that changes are having. 

Planning too far into the future is seen as waste because things will have changed. If you plan 3 months ahead, then the work you've done in between planning an implementing will have changed the conditions so your planning is now invalid, and therefor a waste.

Instead Lean methodology takes the measurements from the changes already made and uses them to plan the next small batch of work. Work is divided into smaller batches so it's effect can be measured, doing too much work before measuring it's impact is wasteful. 

The company avoids waste by applying the Scientific Method to all the work they do. They come up with a hypothesis, perhaps making the sign up button bigger will increase sign ups. They design an experiment to test that idea, usually that means showing the bigger button to a small percentage of people who visit the website and comparing sign ups numbers from those that saw the bigger button to those who didn't.

If your idea is right a larger percentage of the people shown the larger button will have signed up compared to those shown the smaller button. You've done a minimal amount of work and either proven your theory, if it's wrong you've created a minimal amount of waste. 

More traditional theory would have you create a whole bunch of improvements to the site, bigger buttons, more places to sign up and changing the colour of the button to make it stand out more. You might have the situation where one person wants to move the sign up button and another wants more buttons, how do you implement both of those? Software engineers would implement them all the ideas and customers would see them all at the same time. If numbers improved you wouldn't know what had made the difference, and if they didn't you've wasted a lot more time.

Eric provides many more examples along with detailed descriptions of how to apply The Lean Startup to your own company or team in his 2011 book "[The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0670921602/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0670921602&linkCode=as2&tag=stuartgricom-21&linkId=7YEY4DIRAJ554POR)"

For the past 20 years I have worked as a software engineer, over the past 5 years I have been applying some of the techniques from Lean Startups and TPS to the teams I have been part of and they have worked really well, helping the teams increase performance and increase the quality of the work they have produced. When I finished my *FA Youth Module 1* I found that many of the ideas they gave us for coaching kids applied equally well to running a software development team, it turns out that the same things used to motivate young football players work equally well on older software developers, so I set out to discover if this worked the other way round too, can you apply The Toyota Way, Lean Startup and the Scientific Method to coaching footballers.

## Lean Coaching.

More recently I have been thinking about the more progressive ideas from the software industry, or even wider industry in general and could any of them be applied to coaching ... it strikes me that there is *such* a crossover between the ideas from the The Lean Startup, The Toyota Way and those of modern coaching techniques evangelized by coaches like [Nick Levett](https://twitter.com/nlevett) that I'm surprised no-one has made the connection before.

Lines of players waiting 5 minutes to take their turn at a drill are the production lines of football and while they are a way of producing footballers, I don't think that it's the best way to produce quality players, for any level. The time in between turns is waste, and must be eliminated.

## The 6 Pillars of Lean Coaching

The Toyota Way has 6 underlying principles, and I have adapted them below into the language of football teams, and football coaching but you can read the originals on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System#Principles)

### Continuous Improvement

#### Challenge 

*"We form a long-term vision, meeting challenges with courage and creativity to realize our dreams."* Business do this by saying they want to be the best product in a certain market, they want to revolutionize an old industry with new and modern products. In football this ultimately means winning football games, in modern parlance this is what gets called *a project*, managers go to a club because they are impressed by the *owners project*. For your club it might be to win Division A, be seen as a club that produces lots of players for your local professional club's academy or be the club where players enjoy their football the most.

Your *long term vision* is all about ***what*** you want your club or team to achieve and your *long term philosophy* (covered later) is all about ***how*** you achieve it.

The English FA have several courses aimed at the people who run clubs besides coaches, and as well as the weekly running of the club they also help with developing these long therm plans.


#### Kaizen

*Kaizen* is a Japanese word that means '*change for the better*', once you have your challenge, vision or project *Kaizen* is how you get there. It favors smaller, simple changes rather than huge complicated upheavals, as I outlined in the section on Lean Startups, small changes are easier to measure and less wasteful.

In football this could be moving a player to a different position, changing the kind of training you do from drills to more small sided games, they are obvious changes but others include the way you talk to players, they way you as a coach behave during a game or the way spectators behave. Even things like changing what players drink at half time could be seen as *change for the better*.

The question that remains is how do you know the change was for the better?


#### Genchi Genbutsu

*Genchi Genbutsu* roughly translates as *go and see*, in industry that means going down to the shop floor and seeing how things are done and having a go yourself. For a software company it means measuring how long an action takes, seeing how much memory it takes up on customers computers and all the things that can effect the performance of the software. It can also mean going and seeing how people use your product, don't make any assumptions about how it's used. It can also mean watching how people use your competitors products, or looking at how they use existing products in the market you want to improve.

It's easy to think that as a coach you do this because you deliver the training, but just being there and delivering a session is not enough. Are you watching how the players respond? Are you making notes for what to improve next time? Which players benefit the most, which enjoy it the most? Are you sure the players have understood your coaching, asking questions is how you measure their understanding and it is how you learn what else needs to be improved.

It also extends outside of your training sessions, *go and see* someone else deliver a session, how can their ideas and methods improve your team? Many local FAs run monthly events for local coaches, in Sheffield for example they have a coaches club and they regularly have coaches of the caliber of Pete Sturgess, Scott Sellars, Dick Bate and other top coaches. Stuart Pearce & Gareth Southgate have also delivered sessions in the past. They put these events on for coaches to go and learn, they give handouts with sessions & notes for you to take away.

There's more to a football club than just coaching players, all officials in a club should *go and see* whenever they can, the Chair should meet with the clubs that you admire and see how they run things, Child Protection Officers should share best practice, and if you're lucky enough to have a grounds keeper, they should *go and see* how the best pitches in the area are kept in such good shape, they can go to other pitches that suffer from water retention and see how those grounds keepers deal with the problem. 

You should even look at things totally unrelated to football, like how do other clubs make such a good return from their tuck shop, earning more on match days takes some of the burden off those who pay for the players to come to your club, which should take some of the pressure off you as you try and work toward your long term goals.

Continuous Improvement is so much more than just the players.


### Respect for people

There are some obvious connections here to the FA's Respect campaign, and books like The Lean Startup miss out this pillar, but in football it's among the most important. 

You need the players, supporters & club staff to respect you and to get the best from them you need to respect them too. We've all seen when a manager *loses the dressing room*, what they actually mean is that the players no longer respect them, and the quality of their work falls away and they become an ineffective team. I have been on the wrong side of this happening in football and in business and it is terrifying how quickly it happens.


### Long-term philosophy

Think about 3 players, 3 managers or coaches and 3 back room staff that you respect, what is it about these people that has earned your respect? Take 1 quality from each person to make your model player, coach, and use these to build in to your *long term philosophy*.

Base your management decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term goals. If you have a player that will get benefit from playing in a match because they will learn from their experience, but it will probably cost you the match, you should play them. Players learn the most from competing against players that are better than they are

The great San Francisco Head Coach, Bill Walsh, had what he called his *Standard Of Performance*, in Lean Coaching we call this our *Long Term Philosophy*, and he applied it as much to the players and coaches as he did to the receptionists at the stadium and team head quarters, he built a team of coaches and staff around him that he taught this philosophy to and he thought them how to teach it to others. Walsh didn't think of himself as a coach, he was a teacher.

### The right process will produce the right results

I'm going to call out the fact that in the examples in this section 'results' mean winning games or trophies. Don't forget that the right results for your team might not be how many games you win.

This pillar has been applied to sport in the past with spectacular results, perhaps the most successful American Football coach ever, Bill Walsh at the San Francisco 49ers, used to famously say "The Results Take Care of Themselves", and that was the title of his autobiography [The Score Takes Care of Itself, My Philosophy of Leadership](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1591843472/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1591843472&linkCode=as2&tag=stuartgricom-21&linkId=W5ZMCNX3LBS4ULCS), an excellent book for any leader.

On the field Walsh's *Standard Of Performance* simply meant always try your best. In training he expected his players to practice with the aim of getting the play exactly right, not 95% right. For his coaches this meant setting an example to the players, and for receptionists this meant presenting the right image to guests and visitors. When Walsh took over at the 49ers they were a joke of a team, he won the Superbowl in his 3rd season and turned mediocre players like Joe Montana, a 3rd round pick who could throw the ball very far. Walsh saw that what he lacked in distance he made up for with accuracy. Walsh used that to revolutionise NFL offense by designing a series of short sharp attacking plays that used Montana's strength. Montana ended up as an NFL Hall of Fame player and 3 Superbowl MVP's.

Walsh was also excellent at managing people, he knew when was the right time to lose his rag, and when to just nudge a player back on track. This is also part of knowing the right process and Walsh learned it through making his own mistakes & learning from the mistakes of others.

Applying this to football might seem to fly in the face of what I said earlier about not having players queue and wait to take turns at a drill, but in training you don't have to follow the rules exactly. Want to practice corners? Then make every restart a corner, or a thrown in, or a free kick from outside the box. Engineer the situation in your small sided games to increase the frequency of the situation you want to practice.

One of the ways industry improves process is by bringing problems to the surface quickly, the quicker you find them the cheaper they are to fix. Imagine you're making a car and you expect to sell a hundred thousand of them in the next 12 months, so you gather together enough stock to build 100,000 cars, but when the first one rolls off the production line you finf there is a problem with the steering colum, and the solution is to redesign the cockpit to better fit, now you have 99,999 car parts that are pretty much scrap, at best they're taking up expensive warehouse space while you redesign & retool the plant to make the new version of the car. That's a huge problem, a huge PR blunder and more importantly a huge expense to fix it. 

The way Lean companies fix this is to only hold in stock enough steering columns in stock to complete, say, a days worth of cars, that way when they first one rolls off the production line you and it's faulty you only have a days worth of parts sitting around. In reality if you apply the same logic to the manufacture of the steering columns themselves then you'd only have enough stock of steering column parts to build a days worth so you'd spot it before it got into the car. The right process has delivered the right results.

### Add value to the organization by developing your people and partners

This one sounds fairly obvious, better players means a better team. Well, that's probably true but it also covers the rest of the team too, remember Bill Walsh's San Francisco 49ers? Everyone was part of the team.

You might have 1 player who has a loop of cloth on their arm that means they get to call the coin toss at the start of the game, but env=courage all your players to behave like the captain. If a captain is the best player, the one they all respect and look up to, why would you not want them to play like them?

Encourage all your team to give their thoughts on training, on how a match went, on the quality of training balls, on the state of the half time oranges. 

Encourage your supporters to let you know how they think the team is doing, what the tea is like in the canteen. This doesn't mean your team has to be run by committee, but if you don't ask, how do you know what they think? By the same token, challenge them to improve too. How can they be better supporters, how can the team's committee improve, how can you improve.

Everyone involved in your team should agree with it's philosophy, if you've set that philosophy to be the team that wins everything, then all the players have to agree, all the supporters have to agree and all the staff have to agree.

### Continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning

Go and see for yourself to thoroughly understand the situation and the problem (Genchi Genbutsu, 現地現物).

Make decisions slowly by consensus, thoroughly considering all options, implement decisions rapidly, become a learning organization through relentless reflection (Hansei, 反省) and continuous improvement (Kaizen, 改善).

#### The 5 Why's.

The *5 Why's* are a technique from Eric Reis' book, [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0670921602/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0670921602&linkCode=as2&tag=stuartgricom-21&linkId=7YEY4DIRAJ554POR) and it is a technique for getting to the root cause of a problem.


## Implementing Lean Coaching.

Lets take a look at a classic drill used in football clubs up and down the country. Two lines of players, each with a ball and one side feeding their ball to the other who can then go on to shoot. Lets say your squad is 17 players, one of which is the keeper. Not a bad little drill, lots of shooting chances, plenty of shots for the 'keeper to stop, lots of goals. Everyone likes goals.

Lets take a look at what's happening and see if we can identify any waste.
