I've been feeling pretty low for a few weeks now, very busy at work because I'm the only one on my team that seems to have avoided the seasonal lurg, busy at home, shitty weather ... you know, January.

In the process of changing this blog from Tumblr to [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io) I made a little pull request on the project to expose some environment variable I didn't have access to in the Twig templates.

The pull was accepted, appreciated & improved on by other people I don't even know & it really lifted my mood.

The moral of the story? Contribute small things to open source, feel like you acheived something & enjoy the small things.
