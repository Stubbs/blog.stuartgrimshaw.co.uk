RabbitMQ Messages Consumer with PHP
Learn to write long running RabbitMQ message consumers with PHP

My new book is available from all good … actually no, it’s not available from any book store, but you can get it from my website …

The book covers the basics, from publishing simple messages and reading them from the queue to advanced topics like dead letter queues to make applications more robust when things go wrong.

You’ll learn how to make sure that resources aren’t leaked and how to use interrupts to control your processes to make them easier to roll out.
The book is just $25.99 and available now from LeanPub.com
