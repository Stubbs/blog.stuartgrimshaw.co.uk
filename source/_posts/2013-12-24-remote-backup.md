I’m looking for a remote backup solution I can use to back up some folders off site, I’d rather not use some cloud service so I was looking to use something like BitTorrentSync, but have the files at the opposite end encrypted.I want to have my stuff backed up at a relatives house, and let them do the same here, 

I thought about using TrueCrypt on the remote end, but that’s not available for all systems, especially the Netgear NAS I have available, I’m looking to get round that using a RaspberryPi to host the TrueCrypt volume, but that seems a bit convoluted.Anyone done anything similar?
