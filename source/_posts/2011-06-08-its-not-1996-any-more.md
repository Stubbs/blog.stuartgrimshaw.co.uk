Here’s a story of a young guy who works for a company doing a job that he really loves. The problem is that the company he works for is in a real mess. The owners are running the place in a manner that makes coming to work in a morning something to be endured and hated rather than the enjoyable experience you know your friends have doing the same job at another company.


Your manager is very inexperienced and probably put in place because of who he knows rather than what he knows. You don’t get on and that makes it really hard to do what you do as well as you know you can do it. You know because of their inexperience they’re not giving you the leadership you need, but it’s still you that carries the can when it all goes wrong. You can see your friends being given the opportunity to do their job properly and producing better work and you want some of that action too.


One day an opportunity comes along to go and work for another company, one with experienced managers, who understand how you work best and will give you the career boost that you want. What would you do? Where would you go and work?


This story is either about me 7 years ago, or Phil Jones today.


We both made the same decision, we moved on for the sake of our career, our family and our job satisfaction. I challenge any Rovers fan in the same position as Phil not to do the same thing.


And as for the people spewing bile over him going to Manchester United, I’m sorry to tell you but it isn’t 1996 any more. Back then when the team both on and off the pitch was decimated and our best players left for what were lesser teams at the time people were rightly angry about the way all the good work that had been done in just 5 years was undone in just 1 summer break.


Right now Blackburn are a club in the process of being rebuilt. Not after last season’s close scrape but after a decade of decline in our spending power. Whatever you say about Venky’s saying that we’re not a selling club, Phil Jones’ contract was drawn up when we were and £16m was (and still is) a bloody good price for a young centerback.


Back in 1996 Manchester United were our rivals and selling one of our most promising players to them would have been unthinkable, but now we’re lucky to be in the same league so all the best to Phil, maybe we’ll see you back in the Blue & White one day, just like another fans favourite who left us to ply his trade in Manchester when we were down, but returned a better player when we were on the up.


EPILOGUE
It’s 7 years since I left Plusnet, and just over 2.5 years since I came back. In the 5 years I was away I became a better engineer, and now I’m that inexperienced manager, trying not to make the same mistakes that made me leave, but I think I have the advantage of hindsight & hopefully I won’t make _many_ of the same mistakes.
