The current plan to take over Blackburn Rovers by us fans has stepped up a gear today with the the official announcement of the formation of Blackburn Rovers Supporters Investment Trust, it’s a brilliant initiative, and one every Rovers fans should get behind, it represents our best hope for a positive outcome to our troubles.
In that vein, I’m going to present a way in which the club could better engage the fans and better use the website to communicate in a way that no other club currently does. The club would need to ditch their current partner and bring the website under the control of the fans.
The club’s website should be about 3 things, selling tickets, selling good quality merchandise the fans want to buy & be the focal point of the club’s online community.
Lets start at the beginning, and get rid of that awful “Click here to enter” page at the beginning, they didn’t work back in 1997 when they were popular, and they do nothing but confuse visitors. Imagine having to walk round a hairdressers before you could enter the supermarket, it’s the same thing and equally a waste of potential customers time.
Next, the website should be a portal for fans to feel part of their club, so I would ditch all the adverts for credit cards, gambling & financial products, give the ticket store & club shop more prominence and improve the usability of the store in general. I worked as a Senior Engineer at one of the UKs leading online electrical retailers for 3 years, and the lessons learned there would apply equally to selling club merchandise.
Players should feel as much of the community around the club as the fans, I’d want the players to provide content for the site, but not the normal PR spun stories we get now, let them post what they want, let them be honest about the performance, tell the fans what happened in training.
I’d give the youth team a couple of video cameras and let them make videos to post on the site, get the local schools & college involved in editing and uploading the video, learning what it takes to produce good quality videos. I’d give all players access to the club’s Facebook & Twitter accounts and let them post. I’d make it clear when players sign hat they are as much a part of the community around the club as the fans.
I’d start to use technology like Google Hangouts to have live 2-way conversations with fans, all press conferences would be broadcast this way too, with fans able to ask questions as well as journalists.
News and articles could be written by fans, there is a very healthy community of bloggers, fan sites & fan reporters and most of not all the writers for these sites would jump at the chance to write content for the official site, especially if they got the kind of access to the club that is currently reserved for “real” journalists. The site should link out to these sites as well, become another site in the network of Rovers related content on the internet.
So to summarise, the club site needs to drop the advertising of non-related products & services, re-focus on being a place for fans to gets news & merchandise and to be able to interact with players and staff at the club.
What do you think? How would you improve the clubs website? How could it become a better tool for making fans feel more involved with their club?
