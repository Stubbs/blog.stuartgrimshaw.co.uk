About 6 months ago I started to write a Lovefilm client for my Android phone, but I never really got much further than authenticating, and that was mainly down to how big a pain in the ass it was to reliably log in & then store the various authentication tokens.
Fast forward 6 months and the library I used last time is no longer maintained, but there’s a new kid on the block. Scribe is a really neat library from Pablo Fernandez that makes OAuth really simple.
You can see from the examples on Github how easy it is, and it’s not much more difficult to do the same for Android either.  Rather than go into a long, boring description, I’ll just show you!
If anyone would like a more detailed description of what the code is doing, just post a comment below & I’ll help you out.
