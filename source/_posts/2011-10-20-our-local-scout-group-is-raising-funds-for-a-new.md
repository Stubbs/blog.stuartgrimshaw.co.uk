Our local scout group is raising funds for a new scout headquarters in High Green, the current hut was built as a temporary solution in the 60’s when the last one blew down! The roof leaks, the floor is warped and the building is bloody freezing throughout winter. They’re currently raising money to build a swanky new HQ that will last for generations and be a real boon for the kids both now & in the future, not just for my kids now, but for their kids and their kids after that! All you have to do to help is vote for them, and maybe get your friends to vote for them too. Please give them a quick vote, WONT SOMEONE THINK OF THE CHILDREN!!!
