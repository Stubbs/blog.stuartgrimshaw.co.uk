Applying Lean Startup & Lean Production ideas to football clubs and coaching.

## The Toyota Way.

The Toyota Way, or Toyota Production System is the method developed at the manufacturer between 1948 & 1975 by Taichi Ohno and Eiji Toyoda and is widely credited as the main reason Toyota is the world leader that it is today. TPS is all about eliminating waste, in manufacturing this means things like not overproducing, not having too much stock, not moving stock or inventory that doesn't need to be moved, the waste of faulty products. By continuously changing their processes & procedures to get rid of any waste Toyota has risen from making no cars at all to the worlds largest motor manufacturer, overtaking the likes of Ford, General Motors and Volkswagon along the way.

You can read more about The Toyota Way in Jeffrey Liker's book [by the same name](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0071392319/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0071392319&linkCode=as2&tag=stuartgricom-21&linkId=JRNOOC4FX4V425PF)

## The Lean Startup.

Others have seen how succesful the Toyota Way has been and applied it to other industries, perhaps one of the most famous is Eric Reis, the author of The Lean Startup. Eric applies the principle of minimising waste to software development and startups. 

Here waste isn't having too much stock or too much unnecessary movement of labour or products. Instead waste is seen as anything that doesn't move the busness closer to the goals that it has set, and it uses small feedback loops to measure the effect that changes are having. Planning too far into the future is seen as waste because things will have changed, instead it takes the measurments from the changes already made and uses them to plan the next small batch of work. Work is divided into smaller batches so it's effect can be measured, doing too much work before measuring it's impact is wasteful. 

The company avoids waste by applying the Scientific Method to all the work they do. They come up with a hypothesis, perhaps making the signup button bigger will increase sign ups. They design an experiement to test that idea, usually that means showing the bigger button to a small percentage of people who visit the website and comparing signups numbers from those that saw the bigger button to those who didn't. If your idea is right a larger percntage of the people shown the larger button will have signed up compared to those shown the smaller button. You've done a minimal amount of work and either proven your theory, if it's wrong you've created a minimal amount of waste. 

More traditional theory would have you create a whole bunch of improvements to the site, bigger buttons, more places to sign up and changing the colour of the button to make it stand out more. You might have the situation where one person wants to move the signup button and another wan't more buttons, how do you implement both of those? Software engineers would implement them all the ideas and customers would see them all at the same time. If numbers improved you wouldn't know what had made the difference, and if they didn't you've wasted a lot more time.

Eric provides many more examples along with detailed descriptions of how to apply The Lean Startup to your own company or team in his 2011 book "[The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0670921602/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0670921602&linkCode=as2&tag=stuartgricom-21&linkId=7YEY4DIRAJ554POR)"

For the past 20 years I have worked as a software engineer, over the past 5 years I have been applying some of the techniques from Lean Startups and TPS to the teams I have been part of and they have worked really well, helping the teams increase performance and increase the quality of the work they have produced.

## Lean Coaching.

When I finished my FA Youth Module 1 I found that many of the ideas they gave us for coaching kids applied equally well to running a software development team, it turns out that the same things used to motivate young football players work equally well on older software developers. I won't draw any conclusions from that!

More recently I have been thinking about if any of the more progressive ideas from industry could be applied to coaching, and it strikes me that there is such a crossover between the ideas from the books above and modern coaching techniques that I'm suprised no-one has made the connection before.

I'll be posting part 2 soon where I'll discuss the 6 Pillars of Lean Coaching.
