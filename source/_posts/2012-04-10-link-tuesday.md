At last years PHPNW, @LornaJane did a presentation that introduced most of the audience to Link Tuesday, where basically everyone in the department sends round a bunch of interesting links every Tuesday. It’s even spawned it’s own website http://linktuesday.com
Here’s my email I sent today:
First off a handy glossary for CDR related terminology that I found useful over the weekend:

A quick guide for creating & using GPG keys to sign & encrypt email. Who else has a key that they use?
