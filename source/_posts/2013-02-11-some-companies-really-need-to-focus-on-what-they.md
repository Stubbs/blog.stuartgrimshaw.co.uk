As a kind of follow up to my Digital Region post the other day, I was trying to track my recorded delivery letter through the post office website, and was met by this on the front page of the Post Office website

Why are the Post Office advertising mortgages on the front of their website?
Oh well, on to find out where my package got to:


hmm, so I posted a first class recorded delivery letter a week ago, and it’s “being progresses through our network”, but at least I can get a Post Office mortgage. Maybe my payments each month would be progressed through my own delivery network too.
