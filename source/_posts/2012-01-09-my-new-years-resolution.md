Is not to make any more resolutions.
Instead I’m going to follow Matt Cutt’s example and try something new for 30 days at a time. I tried it on and off last year, with mixed success.
My first challenge is 30 days with no TV. That’s no live TV, no iPlayer & nothing recorded on Sky+. Films are Ok, either at home or on DVD.
The idea is that I’ll fill the time I regain with things that ate more constructive, for example I’ve had an idea for a story floating around for years, I’d like to get a synopsis for that finshed, there are a couple of jobs need doing round the house etc. I have a few books I’d like to finish reading too.
There are 2 exceptions.
I can watch Blackburn Rovers if they are on TV.
I can listen to the radio on iPlayer.
but that’s it, just those two things.
I’ve been doing it for almost a week now, and it’s not been too bad. I watched Sherlock last night, and I watched something on Friday that I can’t remember now.
The hardest part is actually filling the time with something constructive, so far it’s mainly been work, which wasn’t part of the plan, it’s not even as though I need to work, the project is going really well.
So I’m drawing up a kind of “schedule”, certain nights will be for certain things, or certain nights will start with certain things. Something like this:
Monday - Reading
Tuesday - Football coaching (planning)
Wednesday - Story
Thursday - Chores
Friday - Games
Saturday - Reading
Sunday - Chores
something like that anyway.
