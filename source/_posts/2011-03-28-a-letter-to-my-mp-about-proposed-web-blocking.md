Here is the full text on an email I’ve sent to my MP via the Open Rights website.


I am sending you this email with little hope that you’ll take heed, given your previous support of the Digital Economy Act, and stock answers to my other letters. I would normally compose my own email but I send this simply as an indication of my opposition to new laws on web blocking when there are perfectly serviceable laws available today.
Website blocking to combat copyright infringement is yet again being pressed forwards by big copyright lobbyists. Just like their previous suggestions, like cutting off people from the Internet, it isn’t the answer.
Music and film companies can already apply to courts to block specific instances of copyright infringement. They can also take the sites to court, and frequently do. They can even take individuals to court, and do.
Web blocking sounds like a simple idea: but the reality is that copyright infringement is complicated and needs proving properly before a company is dealt with through a legal process. And what’s more, such powers already exist, so we can safely assume whatever is being suggested will be easier for copyright holders and harder for innocent people to avoid harm.
And it won’t work. Website blocking can be easily circumvented by anyone remotely determined, but would be very likely to create means for competitors to harm each other and for companies to repress unwanted speech.
Please forward my concerns to the ministers responsible, Ed Vaizey and Jeremy Hunt.
